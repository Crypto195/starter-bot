## Getting Started:

1. Go to the [discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application 
2. Then click on the "bot" area and click "add bot"
3. Copy the token
4. Go to the config.json file and paste you token and add a prefix
5. Go to your terminal and do `npm install` to download all the depedencies 
6. And then do `node server.js` to bring the bot online
7. If you are still having any problems, doubts or anything else join my [support server](https://discord.gg/a68HDQgkc8)

```js
{
  "prefix": "", //your prefix
  "token": "" //your discord bot's token
}
```
